# learnNext14
Repo for the Next.js 14 learn full stack demo site

After coming back from a short break, I learned that Next.js had undergone some rather large changes. I am refreshing myself with the latest material from the documentation found on nextjs.org/learn


# Update

I have decided that since I am doing this repository publicly, I am going to start coding a bit more professionally. 

I am starting to create branches for each chapter of the Nextjs.org/learn content

Within each branch, I will be committing my challenges and code changes and eventually pull request for review
